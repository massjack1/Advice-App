## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- API

### What I learned

One of the major things I learnt or in other words enforced was my Javascript fundimentals. I got to work with Template strings, fetching API's, Arrow functions & structure.  

### Continued development

As I continue to explore the deeper parts of Javascript, I plan to focus more on learning about API's, design patterns and other areas within the subject. There are probably a few concepts that I'm not completely comfortable with yet but I want to take the time and sharpen them. I will also probably go back and see if I can improve each projects that I do.
